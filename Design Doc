In BetaEngine3D, I used integers for the coordinates.
It is not good, because when I need a unit vector, it doesn't work.
Also, when doing calculation, I have to worry about the overflow of the integer value.

So I decide to use double for the coordinates.
It takes twice as much of the memory, but solved the problems above.

Ideas about the texture of a rectangle:
1. use image files, like jpg, and extract the color of the intersection point of the ray.
2. build large objects with small cubes, each small cube has a single color.
This is like MineCraft.

No matter what method, I need to calculate the intersect point and distance.
